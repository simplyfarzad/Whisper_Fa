# Whisper_Fa
Fine-tuning the Whisper model for Persian language.

This is based on the tutorial from huggingface [Fine-Tune Whisper For Multilingual ASR with ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-whisper).

I used the Common Voice dataset 13.0 [mozilla-foundation/common_voice_13_0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mozilla-foundation/common_voice_13_0/viewer/fa/train).
